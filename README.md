# CodeRush
CS 321 Group Project.

Trello Site: https://trello.com/b/0QnGV425 

# Purpose:
This web-application gamifies the process of solving coding problems, similar to platforms like LeetCode, but
with a real-time, competitive twist. Players can solve coding challenges head-to-head or against the clock,
similar to a timed chess game. The objective is to improve coding skills under time pressure, simulating
real-world scenarios like coding interviews. This approach encourages both learning and friendly
competition, making coding practice more engaging and efficient for users

# Implementation

Back-End: `Java` with `SpringBoot` 

Front-End: `ReactJS` with `MUI` (Material-UI)

Database: `MySQL`
